# PROJECT DESCRIPTION (How to play)

This is a 2 player game, where each player has four tokens that they aim to move from their starting area around the board to their home column.

Players take turns rolling a die and moving their tokens accordingly. 

To start, a player must roll a six to move a token out of the starting area onto the board.

The goal is to navigate all four tokens around the board and into the player's home column.

Players move their tokens based on the number rolled on the die. 

Tokens can knock out other tokens by landing on the same space, sending the knocked-out token back to its starting area.

I have taken reference from one you tube channel JavaScript with Sohail, which helped me make my project successful.
